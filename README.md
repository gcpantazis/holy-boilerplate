#Holy Boilerplate, Batman!

I need a new boilerplate, so I'm starting one with a gutted copy of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) as a base.

##TODO

Things it should include:

* Jade templates
* Sass/SCSS
* RequireJS + Backbone. Module pattern w/ CommonJS style.
* Scaffolds to create NodeJS app when needed, with Heroku procfiles, etc.
* Automatic image optimization, with src/optimized directories.
* Grunt build for the above, with logical watches.
* qUnit (perhaps Jasmine) JS Unit tests, nodeunit build tests, Travis CLI integration.
